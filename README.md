# TrafficSentinel
The purpose of the traffic management system is to provide 
detailed information on traffic conditions, with a particular focus on identifying and listing accident-prone areas. 
The system aims to enhance road safety and inform drivers and urban planners about potential hazards, thereby 
contributing to better traffic management and planning decisions.
